Reached a top 8% ranking on the above competion.

The 3 main notebooks are:

Build Dataset.ipynb: Takes csv files available from Kaggle as raw data and creates the dataset used later by the models using all kinds of feature engineering

Lightgbm Model.ipynb: Final model used to generate the submission file. Based on Lightgbm + feature engineering + Bayesian optimization for hyperparameters

Deep Learning Models.ipynb: Several attempts of deep learning architectures, including MLP, Embedding layers for categorical features, Recurrent networks (mainly GRU)
